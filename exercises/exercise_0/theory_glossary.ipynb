    "## 2. Theory questions\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; a) Why could it be good to combine duckdb and pandas?\n",
    "* duckdb is good for more complex queries with sql and is more effective for bigger ammounts of data, good for the base dataframe\n",
    "* pandas is then good for flexible plotting, manipulating, exploring and analyzing the data further, depending on what you want to see\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; b) How do you create a DataFrame in Pandas from a dictionary, a list of dictionaries, and a CSV file, json object?\n",
    "* pd.DataFrame(dict) - for 1 dictionary\n",
    "* pd.DataFrame([dict, dict]) - for a list of dictionaries\n",
    "* pd.read_csv(\"path.csv\")\n",
    "* pd.read_json(\"path.json\")\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; c) What is the difference between .loc[] and .iloc[] for indexing in Pandas?\n",
    "* .loc[\"string\"] locates a named index - label-based\n",
    "* .iloc[0] locates the actual index(number) - index-based\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; d) What is the purpose of the .groupby() method in Pandas? How is it used in data aggregation?\n",
    "* to group by 1 or more columns, and then select columns that you want to aggregate with sum(), mean() etc.\n",
    "* df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; e) How do you export a pandas dataframe into a csv file?\n",
    "* ```df.to_csv(\"name.csv\")```\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; f) How do you save a pandas dataframe into a duckdb database?\n",
    "* connect to the duckdb database with duckdb.connect and save connection as object\n",
    "```py\n",
    "    - con = duckdb.connect(\"db.duckdb\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "* use the duckdb connection-object and call .from_df-function, send in the dataframe object you want to save into the database\n",
    "* then call .create-function and enter prefered table name\n",
    "```py\n",
    "    - con.from_df(df).create(\"table_name\")\n",
    "```\n",
