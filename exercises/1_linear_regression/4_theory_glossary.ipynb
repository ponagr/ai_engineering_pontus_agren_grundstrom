    "- a) Draw an illustration of how machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence relate to each other and explain it with your own words.\n",
    "    - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n",
    "        - **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "            - **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns, often used for images, text, and speech.\n",
    "- b) What is the main difference between regression and classification?\n",
    "    - **Regression**: Predicts a continuous numerical value.\n",
    "    - **Classification**: Predicts a discrete category or class.\n",
    "- c) Give an example of a problem that can be solved with regression\n",
    "    - To predict salary, based on education, experience and location.\n",
    "- d) What does scaling data mean, and why do some machine learning algorithm require data to be scaled?\n",
    "    - Scaling data is when you transform features to be within the same range, like between 0.0-1.0\n",
    "    - Some algorithms depend on the data being similar or between a specific numerical range to work or be reliable\n",
    "- e) What is the purpose to split the data into a training part and a test part?\n",
    "    - to hide a part of the data with right answers so you can evaluate the model on unseen data, to avoid data leakage and overfitting\n",
    "- f) What is data leakage, why is it bad and how can you avoid it?\n",
    "    - its bad because you give all the right answers when evaluating it, because it has already trained on the data, and gives a better outcome than it should, makes it unreliable to evaluate\n",
    "- g) What are some common evaluation metrics for regression models?\n",
    "    - mae, mse, rmse\n",
