    "\n",
    "In the whole exercise, we will work with the famous Iris flower dataset, which was collected in 1936 by Ronald Fisher, a statistician and biologist. Use the `datasets` module from scikit-learn to load the iris dataset.\n",

    "&nbsp; a) Check keys on the loaded data and check what the different values for each key are.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; b) Now insert the data into a DataFrame.\n",

    "&nbsp; c) Do some EDA to get an understanding of the dataset.\n",

    "&nbsp; e) Make a boxplot. The points outside of the boxplot are statistically calculated outliers using Tukey's rule for boxplot.\n",
